# Computer Programming IV

My name is Hector F. Jimenez S, actually I'm taking a course about computer Programming  at the Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira and this is the repository to collect my homeworks, lab assigments, experiments and partial test of the computer programming IV class . I will be coding mainly in Python3 and sometimes in C/C++ this course cover the object oriented programming paradigm, because I'm still learning the big python world there're a list of recommended books in a sequence order in the section below, and offcourse this repo will be documented in spanish(mother tongue), english or french. 

I'm not so good at writing reports but I will do my best effort to explain the concepts learned as much as I can.

Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.
