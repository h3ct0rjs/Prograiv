# Test Cases 

Of course, any good programmer should test their handy work. So, where can we find lots of (hard) Sudoku puzzles to test with? It turns out there is an active group on this web forum and they have compiled a whole bunch of test puzzles from the following sites :

- http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/moac/people/students/peter_cock/python/sudoku
- http://magictour.free.fr/sudoku.htm

Use this to test your time of execution.
