## Small Chess Using PyGame

Because I was wanting to learn pygame to create something useful and implement the design patterns and concepts of OOP I just write this basic game. 

### Requirements 
    * Use a graphical Interface using pygame.
    * Show a list of suggestions when you press a piece. 
    * Implement a class for the piece and inherit to create the specific ones
    * Use sprites to map the image.

### Running the project
To test this game you must need pygame and Debian Gnu/linux enviroment
(it's tested),choose a type of deploy automatic or manual. 

#### Manual Startup
```sh
user@machine: ~/$ pip3 install pygame
user@machine: ~/Lab31Chess$ chmod +x  start.py
user@machine: ~/Lab31Chess$ ./start.py
(ctrl + c to exit)
```
#### Automatic Startup
```sh
user@machine: ~/Lab31Chess$ make up
```

### Documentation
if you're using ipython you can get all the explanation, because I use the docstring descriptions

 ```python 
In [1]: %run start.py
```
